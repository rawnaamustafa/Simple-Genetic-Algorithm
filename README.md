# Simple-Genetic-Algorithm

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) that is implemented for a Computational Intelligence assignment.

## Features
- Generates an initial population of 20 individuals (chromosomes of length 5).
- Uses **fitness calculation** and **relative fitness** to select parents.
- Implements **crossover** and **bit-flip mutation** with adjustable probabilities.
- Tracks **maximum and average fitness** over generations.
- Outputs the final generation and fitness values.

## Files
- `main.py`: Python script implementing the GA.
- `ASS1 Report CI.docx`: Detailed report explaining the GA steps and results.
- `README.md`: This file.
